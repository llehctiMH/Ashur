#Ashur

Ashur is a 2D, top-down single-player fantasy-adventure game, where an owl
faces large bosses and progresses through the levels of Falconmont
to defeat the old gods. Throughout the players journey they will
encounter various increasingly challenging enemies inspired by Mesopotamian mythology.

Production 2:
The  game is in an incomplete and only slightly operational state.
This is due to a variety of problems that were encountered by team members.
A primary desktop used for development had GPU programs that stalled progress on the game.
Additionally the Unity tutorial lectures that were announced did not occur other than making a Main Menu. 
The quarantine and extended Spring Break disrupted development meetings with team members which complicated the approach to game feature implementations.
A reoccuring C# error made testing difficult. This error persisted through reinstalls of .NET as well as confirming .NET was in the PATH. This meant scripts for movement were not able to be run, the error follows:
"Error: The reference assemblies for .NETFramework,Version=v4.7.1 were not found"
